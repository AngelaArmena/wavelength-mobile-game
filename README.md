<h1 align="center">Wavelength Mobile Game</h1>

This is a simple app based on the 'wavelength' board game by CMYK. 

It can be played by 2 or more people. One will be the guesser and one will be the clue giver. You can play with at least four players to have yourselves a match between two teams.

## RULES

- The clue giver will long press the teal knob at the bottom middle of the screen to reveal where the colored target is positioned. Then long press again to hide the target.
- The clue giver will give clues based on the prompts at the lower left and right that will help the guesser position the needle as close to the target as possible.
- After clues are given the players can now press on the knob to reveal the answer.
- Press again to have a new game and start back at the first bullet of the rules.

**Pointing System:**
- yellow = 1pt
- orange = 2pts
- teal = 3pts

## RECOMMENDATIONS
The needle is not properly set so that it will be in the middle of each of the slice of the semi circle so fixing this would make the game a whole lot better. An automatic pointing system could also be added. More prompts can also be done.
